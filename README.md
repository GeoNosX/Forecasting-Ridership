ðŸš‡ Chicago City Ridership Prediction using Deep Learning

This project focuses on forecasting public transportation ridership in the city of Chicago using deep learning models. 
Leveraging historical ridership data, I implemented and compared several recurrent neural network architectures including LSTM, GRU, and hybrid models to capture temporal patterns and improve prediction accuracy.

ðŸ“Š Goal
The main objective is to build models that can accurately predict future ridership, supporting urban planning, resource allocation, and congestion management.

ðŸ§ª Evaluation Metrics
The models were evaluated using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
RÂ² Score: 94%

ðŸ“ˆ Results
The best model achieved:
RÂ² Score: ~94%
Strong generalization on unseen data
Clear seasonality and trend capture in predictions
